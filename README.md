# py-term
A simple terminal written in python and only supported on debian (Ubuntu, Debain, etc), uses os. This is one of my first programs ever, I wrote this library as I
was learning python, This "terminal" has a word guessing game, a simple timer, and a simple calculator this program will incorperate more and more as I learn,
this is currently very basic and only includes a small collection of programs.
